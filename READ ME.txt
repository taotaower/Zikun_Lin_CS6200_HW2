READ ME *******************

To run these Page Rank code, you need to make sure your python version is 2.7.10

You can run any python file in the submitted folder by using command line "python theNameOfTheFile.py"

like run 'webCrawler HW1.py', u type "python webCrawler HW1.py"

To make sure u get the exactly the required result of the task in the output url-files, u can rename the submitted files,

or you can change the output files' name in the code line "f = open("theNameOfTheFile.txt", "a")"

or clean the contents in them, before you run the python file, otherwise you will get duplicate result than expected,

thank you.
